## Education
- Ph.D., Economics | Goethe University Frankfurt (_March 2022_)								       		

## Work Experience
### Data Analyst @ Deutsche Bundesbank (_March 2021 - Present_)

- Analyse issues related to data collected from one of the largest [business surveys](https://shorturl.at/xzSV1) in Germany. Prepared monthly summaries from the latest data that highlighted
the main insights of firms’ subjective beliefs and perceptions about prices, interest rates and other key business indicators. Analysed data from A/B tests and firm retention rates to help
provide data-driven insights on what path to pursue next. 

- Analysed and supported a project about German household expenditure patterns using daily point-of-sale data. The findings were published in a working paper and were reported on by [German media outlets](https://shorturl.at/kHJP2) in 2021 and also in [leading international research centres](https://shorturl.at/uARU6) 

### Senior Researcher @ Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE (_Aug 2016 - Jul 2021_)
- Conducted doctoral research related to consumption patterns of Dutch households in the presence of different income changes. 
- Supported many projects from my doctoral supervisor, [Nathanael Vellekoop](https://www.nvellekoop.nl/), including one that found that looked at the relationship between the subjective beliefs of future
prices and the current saving behaviour of Dutch households. Performed an end-to-end analysis that involved understanding a complex entity diagram to merge independently run datasets that contained information from the same household. This was published as a [working paper](https://shorturl.at/cjT350)

## Projects
### Age, Wealth, and the MPC in Europe - A Supervised Machine Learning Approach
[Working Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Used machine learning methods such as decision trees, random forest and XGBoost to assess whether differing wealth distributions and retirement systems across different Eurozone countries affect household consumption patterns. Using data from the 2017 wave of the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), we find that these differing wealth distributions and retirement systems are relevant to European policymakers due to the joint Eurozone monetary policy and increasing supranational fiscal authority of the EU.
