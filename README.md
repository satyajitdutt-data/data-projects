### Data Analyst @ Deutsche Bundesbank (March 2021 - Present)
- Analysed and supported a project about German household expenditure patterns using daily point-of-sale data. The findings were published in a working paper and were reported on by [German media outlets](https://shorturl.at/kHJP2) in 2021 and also in [leading international research centres](https://shorturl.at/uARU6)
- Analysed data from A/B tests and firm retention rates to help provide data-driven insights on what path to pursue next. 
- Prepared monthly summaries from one of the largest [business surveys](https://shorturl.at/xzSV1) in Germany that highlighted the main insights of firms’ subjective beliefs about key business indicators, prices and interest rates.


### Data Analyst @ Leibniz Institute SAFE (Aug 2016 - Jul 2021)

## Research
### Age, Wealth, and the MPC in Europe - A Supervised Machine Learning Approach
[Working Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4360002)

Used machine learning methods such as decision trees, random forest and XGBoost to assess whether differing wealth distributions and retirement systems across different Eurozone countries affect household consumption patterns. Using data from the 2017 wave of the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), we find that these differing wealth distributions and retirement systems are relevant to European policymakers due to the joint Eurozone monetary policy and increasing supranational fiscal authority of the EU.
